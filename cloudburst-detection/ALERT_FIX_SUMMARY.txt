   - Affected nodes list
   - Recipients list

2. /nodes/{nodeId}/alerts/{alertId}
   - Links alert to each node
   - Node-specific alert info
   - Acknowledgment status

3. /logs/{logId}
   - System log entry
   - Alert metadata

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

"No success message"
→ Check console for errors
→ Verify nodes selected
→ Check Firebase connection

"Alert not on /alerts page"
→ Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
→ Check Firebase Console
→ Look at console logs

"Popup blocked"
→ Allow popups for localhost
→ Check browser settings
→ Look for popup blocker icon

"View All Alerts shows (0)"
→ No alerts created yet
→ Create test alert
→ Wait 1-2 seconds

========================================
QUICK TEST
========================================

1. Open: http://localhost:3002/admin
2. Press F12 (open console)
3. Scroll to "Manual Alert Creation"
